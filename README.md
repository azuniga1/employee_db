* Inspect the CSV's and sketch out ERD of the tables
* Design tables to hold data in CSV's
* Import CSV's into PostgreSQL

## Data Modeling
* Inspect the CSV files in data folder (above) and sketch out an ERD of the tables. I used this free tool    (http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com)

## Data Engineering
After creating our ERD we will use it to create our table Schema for each of our six CSV files with specific data types, priamry keys, foreign keys and any other constartaints we might have.
